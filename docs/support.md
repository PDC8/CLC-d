## ⚙️ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: The alarm is not stopping after solving the problem. What should I do?**  
A: Make sure you submit your solution and that it passes successfully on LeetCode. The app detects success based on three conditions:  
1. The submission is for the **correct question**.  
2. The submission time is **after the alarm time**.  
3. The submission **passes all test cases**.  

Additionally, make sure the **username in your profile matches the account you submitted with on LeetCode**.

**Q: I found a bug. How can I report it?**  
A: Please email us or open an issue on GitHub if the app is open-source. Include as many details as possible (device, iOS version, and steps to reproduce).

**Q: Can I suggest new features?**  
A: Absolutely! We love feedback. Please email us your ideas.
